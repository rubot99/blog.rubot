<p>Yesterday I attended the Developer, Developer, Developer event in Glasgow. It was the first time I have been to a DDD event and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The event was well organised and the content in the sessions were excellent. The event thoroughly exceeded my expectations. There were so many interesting sessions that if I had the chance I would have attended them all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I attended the following sessions at DDD:</p>
<p>CQRS and Friends: Possibly distributed systems, intentionally  – Andrea Magnorsky</p>
<p>This was an introductory session on CQRS/ES.</p>
<p>Caliburn.Micro: Painless MVVM apps for Silverlight and WPF – Barry Carr</p>
<p>This session was a good introduction to using Caliburn Micro with Silverlight. The step by step code demo on using Caliburn Micro was really useful and good. Caliburn Micro seems like a really cool MVVM framework and I am planning try it out on a small project.</p>
<p>Unit Testing, Test Driven Development and the Walking Skeleton – Seb Rose</p>
<p>A detailed talk explaining TDD and the pros and pit falls you might face when using TDD in your team.</p>
<p>Is your code S.O.L.I.D? – Nathan Gloyn</p>
<p>I initially was expecting this talk to be a detailed description about SOLID principles, but was pleasantly surprised to see that Nathan had code examples too.</p>
<p>Functional Alchemy: Tricks to keep your C# DRY* – Mark Rendle</p>
<p>This was another excellent session with a great code demo. One of the things Mark discussed was a try-catch functional strategy which I think I’m going to start using in my code.</p>
<p>It was a great developer event and I am tempted to go to the DDD South West event next month.</p>
