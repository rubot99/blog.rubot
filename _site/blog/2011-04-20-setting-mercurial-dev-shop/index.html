<p>For a long time I have wanted to use a distributed source control management tool at work. I have looked at both Mercurial and Git and decided that I would like try Mercurial. So recently I have had the opportunity to use Mercurial on a new project.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have used Visual Source Safe briefly and have mostly used Subversion with TortoiseSVN. So I found it quite easy to switch to TortoiseHg. I am still getting to grips with Mercurial, but I have really enjoyed using it and think I will permanently move to using Mercurial.</p>
<p>Finally I wanted to setup a stable repository for the project so that I could push my changes to a Mercurial server and in the future setup cruise control to pull the changes from a central location. Also it would allow my manager to view the changes without having TortosieHg installed on his machine.</p>
<p>Since we are a Microsoft dev shop, I decided it would be easier to setup Mercurial on IIS. I found quite a few posts on setting up Mercurial on IIS 7, but had quite a difficult time getting it to work. I have also found differences in the setup process for Windows Server 2008 R2 (64 bit) and Windows Server 2008 (32 bit). So in this post I am going to list the blog articles that helped me to setup a Mercurial server successfully.</p>
<p>I started off by experimenting on a Windows Server 2008 (32 bit) VM (Virtual Machine). After many attempts I finally found a combination of two blogs post that helped me get Mercurial running.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jake Murzy’s Blog – Installing and Setting Up Mercurial on Windows/IIS7 running Python</li>
<li>Matt Hawley – Setting up Mercurial server in IIS7 using a ISAPI module</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I didn’t have a problem installing isapi-wsgi on the virtual machine since the virtual machine had the MSVCR71.dll file in the System32 folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>VM Details: 32-bit Microsoft Windows Server 2008, 1GB RAM and 16GB HDD running on VMWare server.</p>
<p>The Virtual Machine also had the following software products installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox/Chrome</li>
<li>7 zip</li>
<li>Notepad++</li>
<li>VM Ware tools</li>
<li>IIS 7 with IIS 6 Management Compatibility and Application development services installed</li>
</ul>
<p>After following the instructions from the two posts I got the Mercurial web interface working. However when I came to install it on a server running Windows 2008 R2 (64 bit), I couldn’t seem to get it to work. So after googling a bit I found the following post which helped me get Mercurial setup on my server.</p>
